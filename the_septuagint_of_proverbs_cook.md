# The Septuagint of Proverbs - Jewish and/or Hellenistic Proberbs?: Concerning the Hellenistic Colouring of LXX Proverbs by Johann Cook

2: "...the LXX was indeed the first exegetical commentary on the Hebrew Bible and that it should not be seen as relevant only, or even primarily, for textual criticism."

17: "In certain books of the Septuagint there is a definite and clear distinction between the OG and the later hexaplaric additions...The same distinction is unfortunately not possible in the Septuagint of Proverbs."
> De Lagarde's rules: 1) wenn ein vers oder verstheil in einer freien und in einer sklavisch treuen uebertragung vorliegt, gild die erstere als die echte. 2) wenn sich zwei lesarten nebeneinander finden, von denen die eine den masoretischen text ausdrukt, die andere nur aus einer von ihm abweichenden urschrift erklaert werden kann, so ist die letzere fur urspruenglichen zu halten.

19: "The discovery of this phenomenon [adaptation toward the Hebrew] in the context of the book of Proverbs is nevertheless significant for the unraveling of its complicated textual history. It could have the implication that some of the double translations mentioned earlier are in fact pre-hexaplaric phenomena."

20: "There is a direct relationship between what has come to be known as double translations, the hebraizing tendency mentioned and the hexaplaric text."

30: "Translation technique, the way the translator actually rendered his parent text, has to do with more than just linguistic analysis, even though this analysis forms the basis for interpretation...the translator made specific linguistic choices on account of religious considerations."

31: "Aejmelaeus accepts that there are currently three distinguishable approaches to translation technique followed by scholars: the more technical, statistical approach concentrating on verifiable details of the relationship between the translation and its _Vorlage_; the linguistic approach in which the main interest is the Greek language produced by the translators; and finally the exegetical approach endeavoring to find interpretational elements in the translation... _I am naturally in the latter approach_ (italics mine)"

35: "...the translator of Proverbs must have had an excellent education"

316: "The bottom line of his approach can be defined as the drive to make the intention of his parent text, _as he understood it_, evident to his readers."

317: "He should be seen asn an extremely competent translator, perhaps another one of the best...this translation should be seen as a religious document."

318: "It was not the _detail_ of his parent text that was important to this translator, but its _intention_."

327: "...this translation unit (Proverbs) should perhaps be placed in Jerusalem."
