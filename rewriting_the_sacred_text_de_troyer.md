# Rewriting the Sacred Text: What the Old Greek Texts tell us about the Literary Growth of the Bible by Kristen de Troyer

1: "Scholars use the term 'Rewritten Scripture' to indicate literature that is based on Scripture but not identical with it. This means that the 'Sacred Text' - and more precisely, the canonical Biblical Text - lies at the base of the rewritten text...Calling a text rewritten sets up a dichotomy between biblical and non-biblical texts, between texts which are being rewritten - the source texts - and the rewritten texts themselves - the (new) final product. This is, in my opinion, a false dichotomy, for the biblical text is often nothing other than a rewritten text itself."

4: "...I wonder to what extent we can distinguish between, on the one hand, biblical texts and, on the other hand, Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha."

6: "Current research on the texts discovered in the Judean Desert and elsewhere, however, has called into question the standard belief that the old translations can always be used for the reconstruction and interpretation of the Hebrew biblical text."
