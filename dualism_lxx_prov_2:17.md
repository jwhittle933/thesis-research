# Dualism in the LXX of Prov 2:17: A Case Study in the LXX as Revisionary Translation, by Ronald L. Geise Jr. 

289: "The LXX of Proverbs is of special interest since introductory works on the LXX refer to it as a 'loose' or 'paraphrastic' translation, often placing it at the extreme end of a spectrum opposite 'literal'. To do so, however, is very misleading. Though the style of Greek iis quite inconsistent, revealing various hands at work in the process of translation, with rare exceptions the LXX of Proverbs carries the sens of the Hebrew quite well."

292: "As stated above, the translator is not interested in wholesale alterations but rather in subtle changes, interpretations of what he saw as figures or symbols (the strange woman here stands for bad councel)."
