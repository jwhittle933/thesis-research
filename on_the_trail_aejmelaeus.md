# On the Trail of the Septuagint Translators: Collected Essays by Anneli Aejmelaeus

1: "...we actually know nothing about the external conditions in which the work was done."

2: "...there is no ideal percentage by which the performance of the translators could be measured."

69: "Study of translation technique aims at describing the end-product of a translator's work. It cannot be a question of discovering the system used by the translator, because there was none."

72: "That the original cannot determine how one should understand the translation should be self-evident...the Septuagint was regarded as authoritative Scipture, not just a cipher to the Hebrew Scripture."

75: "The Greek text of the Septuagint - whether good or bad, correct or incorrect, intentional or unintentional - should be interpreted as such according to the meanings and rules of Greek and according to the probable understanding of an original native speaker."

78: "...observations made about the text of one book cannot be generalized to cover other books."

79: "If and only if we have at our disposal the original Greek text of the translators is there any hope of reaching the _Vorlage_."

85: "In the Greek Proverbs the tendency toward natural Greek usage leads as far as the substitution of entirely different proverbs for those found in Hebrew."

89: "...knowing that the translators considered the text they translated to be authoritative Scripture and, on the other hand, that most of them, after all, were fairly literal, it would seem to be a good rule of thumb to start with the assumption that larger divergences from the MT mainly come from the _Vorlage_, and only exceptionally and with imperative reasons to attribute them to the translator."

92: "If harmonizations most probably originated with the copying of the Hebrew text and came to the Septuagint through its _Vorlage_, there is all the more reason to assume that Septuagintal plusses with no parallel and plusses bringing new information were already present in the _Vorlage_."

93: "It is in linguistically difficult passages in poetry that we are faced with text-critical decisions which may completely change the interpretation of the whole passage."
