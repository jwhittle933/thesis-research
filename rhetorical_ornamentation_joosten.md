# "Rhetorical Ornamentation in the Septuagint: The case of grammatical variation" by Jan Joosten, in Et sapienter et eloquenter: Studies on Rhetorical and Stylistic Feature of the Septuagint, eds. Eberhard Bons and Thomas J. Kraus

12: "The style of the version is strange to the extent that the Greek slavishly follows the Hebrew."

13: "The use of non-literary Greek hardly reflects a deliberate option on the part of the translators."

13-14: "Since the biblical text must have had high prestige for the translators, it makes no sense to suppose that they inentionally cast the translation in substandard language."

14: "Readers are reminded that this is not a Greek text, but a Hebrew one in translation...Jewish readers, who possessed some familiarity with the Bible, may have appreciated the exotic quality of the Septuagint."

15: "Obviously, free translation - such as we find in Isaiah, Job, Proverbs, Daniel, and Esther - leaves much more room for stylistic aspirations thatn does literal translation."

16-17: "The case for stylistic ornamentation can be built only on renderings diverging from the Hebrew source text in a way that is not dictated by the Greek language."
