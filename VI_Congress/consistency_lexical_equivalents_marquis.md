"Consistency of Lexical Equivalents as a Criterion for the Evaluation of Translation Technique", Galen Marquis

405: We have expressly defined the latter notion, of literalness, in accordance with a strictly text-critical orientatin (as opposed to prevailing mostly intuitive and even value-oriented definitions) as follows: Literalness in a translation is the degree of adherence to the source language reflected in the language of the translation, measured relatively to a perfectly literal translation.

406: We thus define consistency as follows: 
```
Consistency is the degree to which a word in the source text is translated by one word in the translation (lexical equivalent), relative to the total number of occurrences of the word in the source text. A translation of a word in the source text which occurs only once in the translation is called a singular translation
```
406: The tendency toward consistency in the translation of the words of the source derives, as does preservation of the word order of the source, from the translator's desire to reflect his source faithfully.

407: The perfect translation referred to in our definition of literalness above, would thus be one in which it would be possible to retranslate from the Greek the original Hebrew words of the source (not the original language -- an impossible task) with complete correctness.

408: Our examination of the degree of consistency proceeds from the assumption that the translator did indeed have -- at least in his head -- such a "glossary" of equivalences and that the consistent use of this glossary reflects the degree of literalness of the translation.

409: A literal translator, then, will reveal a more or less strong tendency to employ stereotyped lexical equivalences in translating his source. Consistency in itself should thus not be considered a definite method of translating individual words but an additional aspect (additional, for example, to word order) of the reflection of the language of the souce (in this case, the _words_ of the source) in the language (words) of the translation.
