# Double Translations in the Septuagint, by Zipora Talshir

21: "...'double translations', that is, cases of one item in the Masoretic Text (MT) being matched with two items in the Septuagint (LXX)...there is ample space for divergence of opinion in deciding what exactly are 'double translations'."

22: "The first, unequivocal, self-evident rule would be that 'double translation' takes place in the target language."

22-23: "When deciding on a 'double translation' we should be positive that both items are established equivalents of the single parallel item in the Vorlage, or, at least, that they have to be traced back to it and not to a possible pair of words in a larger Vorlage."

23: "Secondly, we should distinguish between 'double translations' and other expanded renderings that serve the translators in their exegetical efforts to suit their Vorlage...In other words, each of the two renderings now joined in the 'double translation' could have been an independent equivalent to the relevant Vorlage-item. When only the two combined translation-items together can function as an equivalent for the single Vorlage-item we are no longer dealing with 'double translations' proper."

26: "Another sort of exegetical technique that comes close to 'double translation', but still should not be considered as such, is the gloss...The duplicity should be the result of two different solutions provided to one and the same problem presented by the Vorlage-item."

27: "The third distinction or rather need of differentiation emerges as we try to define more accurately what is denoted by 'double translation'. 'Double translation' may be defined from the point of view of the process of formation or from the point of view of the result of this process. Formally, we use the term 'double translation' to describe a given situation in which one unit in the Vorlage has for its equivalent two alternate units in the translation...Essentially, we would have preferred to describe 'double translation' from the point of view of its provenance, its creator's identity and purpose.'
In the first place we see in 'double translation' a practice of a translator, who examines a word in his Vorlage, strives to find its appropriate equivalent, and ends up with two suggestions none of which he is willing to give up; then he decides to retain both and let the reader benefit from their combined advantages. We may express this process in three principles:"
```
1. The 'double translation' as emerging from the hand of a single translator.
2. The 'double translation' as an intentional creation.
3. Thd 'double translation' as an exegetical process.
```

28: "Tranlation technique applies only to a small percentage of existing 'double translations'."

29: "It would be rather presumptuous to think we are able to establish objective criteria for distinguishing doublets that are the result of creative translating and those effected in the process of transmission...We should be familiar with the translation technique of a certain translator and with the history of transmission of his work in order to enable ourselves to evaluate the nature of any 'double translation'."

30: "This rule, of course, does not apply to a translator whose work is far from being literal or even borders on the Midrashic; he may certainly be suspected of using 'double translation' as one of his exegetical tools...Finally, there is the question of the priority of one of the two items that constitute the 'double translation'."

33: "Synonymous words. It seems that the classical 'double translation' constitutes of two synonymous equivalents of the Vorlage...Two synonymous renderings of one word in the Vorlage are readily recognized as a 'double translation'."

35: "'Double Translation' as the result of ascribing to one and the same word two different meanings, due to a) semantic, or b) etymological considerations."

36: "Phenomena such as the interchange of graphically or phonetically similar letters or words, metathesis etc., that are normally the catalyst for a whole range of errors in reading and writing in different text-witnesses, may also be the cause of 'double translations'...the only reason to label most doublets which reflect variants as 'double translations' is the bare fact that they reached us in the translation and not in a Hebrew manuscript."

37: "The items of 'double translation' are usually located by each other. This is their most natural position and in this position they are readily recognized as parts of the 'double translation'."

39: "The two parts of the doublet are most often connected with a copulative element...In the majority of 'double translations' there is a καί to join their different parts."
