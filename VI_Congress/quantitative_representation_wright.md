"The Quantitative Representation of Elements: Evaluating 'Literalism' in the LXX", by Benjamin G. Wright

311: The characterization by scholars of ancient Greek biblical translations as either literal or free or somewhere in between has played a determining role in how much confidence can be placed in reconstructions of the Hebrew _Vorlagen_ of those translations.

311: Both Barr and Tov have stressed the need for more precise and accurate means of determining the degree of literalism of a translation. They have argued that literalism in biblical translations is not a one dimensional problem, but is a multi-faceted phenomenon, comprised of five basic components:
1) consistency of lexical rendering (stereotyping)
2) the representation of the constitutent parts of Hebrew words by individual Greek elements (segmentation)
3) word order
4) the quantitative representation of elements
5) thte linguistic adequacy of lexical choices

313: ...when measured by different indicators a translation could be both "free" and "literal" at the same time...In other words, each of the components of literalism set out by Barr and Tov need to be examined individually for each translation and, at the same time, the idea of describing a translation using the blanket terms "literal" and "free" needs to be relegated to a place of secondary importance. 

315: Quantitative representation can be though of as the division by the translator of multi-word Hebrew units into their constitutent parts producing a one-to-one representation in Greek. These units can be particular syntactical units, entire sentences, or even larger contextual units.

316: Segmentation, as Barr and Tov present it, is the one-to-one representation of each element of a Hebrew _word_.

321: Types of deviation from a quantitatively equal representation
1) Making the subject of a verb explicit (p. 322)
2) The use of additional prepositions (p. 322)
3) The use of additional particles or conjunctions (p. 323)
4) The use of forms of `εἰμί` (p. 324)
5) Differences in positive and negative aspects of the verb (p. 325)
6) Differences in active and passive voice (p. 325)
7) The use of additional pronouns (p. 326)
8) The use of additional relative pronouns (p. 326)
9) The translation of idiomatic expressions (p. 327)
10) The translation of one Hebrew word by two or more Greek words (p. 328)
11) Exegetical renderings (p. 329)
