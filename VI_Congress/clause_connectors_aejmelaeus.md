"The Significance of Clause Connectors in the Syntactical and Translation-Technical Study of the Septuagint" in _VI Congress of the International Organization for Septuagint and Cognate Studies_, by Anneli Aejmelaeus.

361: Scholars from different backgrounds, however, seem to have different expectations of what could be gained by this kind of study.

361: It is literalness that attracts attention. As Barr aptly remarks in his _Typology of Literalism_, even the analysis of what is literalism and freedom in translation more suitably takes literalism as its point of departure, since freedom is not a tangible method. It is true that all the Septuagintal translations are more or less literal. But none of them is perfectly literal. In fact, if they were perfectly literal, the study of translation technique would be very dull. It is the deviations from the literal mode of translation and deviations from the form of the original in favour of genuine Greek expressions which point up the differences between the translators and the individual features of each translator.

362: The correct appreciation of free renderings presupposes their examination in the context of other, literal renderings of the kind of expression in question.

365: The only criterion of correctness is that the information conveyed by the whole does not change. Now, the Septuagint translators were naturally not conscious of these theoretical considerations, but they could, nevertheless, through their intuition occasionally end up with a change of construction in order to secure the meaning of the whole and to use a more natural Greek expression.

369: It is true that it is difficult to determine how great a difference in percentage should be considered significant.

378: Exact percentages of literalness are of little help if nothing is known of the actual renderings used. Importance should be attached to the description of the freedom of the individual translators.
