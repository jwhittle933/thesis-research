# NETS (New English Translation of the Septuagint) Front Matter

xiv: "While it is obvious that the so-called Septuagint _in time_ achieved its independence from its Semitic parent, and that it _at some stage_ in its reception history sheds it subservience to its source, it is equally true that it was, at its stage of production, a Greek _translation_ of a Hebrew (or Aramaic) _original_. That is to say, the Greek had a dependent and subservient _linguistic_ relationship to its Semitic parent."

xiv: "Looked at from a different perspective, NETS is presupposing a Greek translation which aimed at bring the Greek reader to the Hebrew original rather than bringing the Hebrew original to the Greek reader. Consequently, the Greek's subservience to the Hebrew may be seen as indicative of its aim."
