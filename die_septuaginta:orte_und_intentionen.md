# Die Septuaginta - Orte und Intentionen herausgegeben von Sigfried Kreuzer, Martin Meiser, und Marcus Sigismund

## A Case study of LXX Proverbs, LXX Job, and 4 Maccabees by Johann Cook
60: "Surely, a translator who approaches his parent text as creatively on all levels must have had 'ideological/theologcal' reasons to do so"

62: "I think the conservative Jewish translator has reused typical Jewish exegetical traditions regarding the good and evil inclinations that, accoding to Judaism, are found in each person."

## Did the Septuagint Translators Really Intend the Greek Text as it is? by Theo A.W. van der Louw
449: "It is the current belief that the Greek text of the Septuagint was willed by the translators in all its details."

451: "If recovering the role of intention turns out to be so complex in a homicide case, we should expect it to be even more so in the case of the translation process."

453: "...the textual-linguistic make-up of the text is crafted in a way that optimally serves the intended function."

455: "...it is atypical for an initiator to invest large sums in a translation without bothering to monitor its outcome...the Greek text itself give no hints that it was produced on an unlimited budget. It did not meet literary standards but, on the contrary, caused embarassment to native speakers."

457-8: "...[translational] experience can decrease the level of intention. However, what does not normally happen with driving does happen with translating: experience can also _increase_ alertness."

461-2: "If the approach is free, free renderings are the subsidiary actions. LXX-Job and Proverbs are translations that come close to the Roman translation practice of _aemulatio_...Free additions, such as we find them in LXX-Proverbs, fit into the strategy of embellishing the source text and are not solicited by obstacles...I am inclined to consider the composition of, e.g., Proverbs 6:8A-C as an instance of prior intention."
