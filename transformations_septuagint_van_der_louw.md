# Transformations in the Septuagint: Towards an Interaction of Septuagint Studies and Translation Studies, by Theo A.W. van der Louw

250: "We can consider LXX-Proverbs a prose translation despite the stichic lay-out that copyists handed down."

257: "The almost inevitable outcome, 'stichic prose', is a text of a hybrid nature. Its appearance suggests poetry, but it is not."

349: "Although the translator of LXX-Proverbs has long been known as a free translator, literal translation constitutes the backbone of his work."

350: "_Clarity_ is a major concern of the translator, as is attested by additions (6:3, 4), explications (6:6, 14, 22, 28, 31), and other transformations (6:10, 18, 24)."

351: "Is has long been observed that the 'additions' in LXX-Proverbs are mainly concentrated in the first part of the book, especially in chapters 1-9. In later chapters the number of additions decreases...While presenting a clear and understandable message, the translator is also intent on presenting it _in an attractive way_."

352: "The _translator_ possessed an excellent, probably native fluency in Greek."

353: "In all likelihood the translator was Jewish, being of the opinion that a translated piece of Israelite wisdom would add something to the non-Jewish wisdom to which his readership had access...The translator chose his 'equivalents' freely, not committed to the lexicon of the Greek Pentateuch."
