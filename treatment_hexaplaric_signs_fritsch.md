# The Treatment of the Hexaplaric Signs in the Syro-Hexplar of Proverbs, by Charles T. Fritsch

169: "Then, too, the Greek translation of Proverbs is characterized by a certain freedom of expression and by certain peculiarities in the mode of translating."

169-170: "Hebrew sentences are recast in an entirely new form in the Greek by taking liberties with grammatical forms and syntax, or by simply guessing at the meaning of the Hebrew expression"

170: "...it is clear that the translator(s) was not bound by any well-established translation-tradition, or by a sacrosanct attitude toward the Hebrew text."

170: "76 examples of these double translations have been found, and are classified as follows: (abridged to include only ch. 1-9)"
```
1. Double translations of verses: 1:7; 2:21; 3:15; 6:11
2. Double translations of a single stichos of a verse: 1:14, 27; 2:2, 3, 19; 4:10; 5:23; 6:25; 8:10; 9:10
3. Double translations of phrases: 2:18; 6:3, 10
4. Double translations of words: 3:10, 18, 23; 5:19
```
170: "It should also be mentioned that the following examples are doubtful, and so have not been included in the above list:"
> 1:4, 21; 6:10, 11; 9:2, 6

170: "To the list of doubles given above there may be added 15 more examples which have come to light by comparing the variant readings found in the different uncials, minuscules, in the early Church Fathers, and other sources:"
> 9:7, 8

171: "In 31 of the examples of the doublets noted above in the Greek text, SH has retained either the obelus or the asterisk from the fifth column of Origen's Hexapla, leavning 45 doublets without any sign at all. Thus we can say that SH did not 'scrupulously' retain all of the Origenian signs from the fifth column of the Hexapla, and we shall note later on that the wrong sign was used in a good many instances in SH."
