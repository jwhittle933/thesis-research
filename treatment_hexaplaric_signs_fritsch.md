# The Treatment of the Hexaplaric Signs in the Syro-Hexplar of Proverbs, by Charlest T. Fritsch

169: "Then, too, the Greek translation of Proverbs is characterized by a certain freedom of expression and by certain peculiarities in the mode of translating."

169-170: "Hebrew sentences are recast in an entirely new form in the Greek by taking liberties with grammatical forms and syntax, or by simply guessing at the meaning of the Hebrew expression"

170: "...it is clear that the translator(s) was not bound by any well-established translation-tradition, or by a sacrosanct attitude toward the Hebrew text."
