# Proverbs: An Ecclectic Edition with Introduction and Textual Commentary by Micael V. Fox

38: "In any case, the different large-scale ordering seen in G-Proverbs has no inherent connection to the translator's other changes and shows no signs of being the translator's doing."

39: "To call G-Proverbs 'free' is imprecise and insufficient, because there are many kinds of freedom, many ways of diverging from the source text."

40: "I prefer to describe the translation technique of G-Proverbs as 'flexible'...When we allow for the translator's flexibility, G-Proverbs proves to be, on the whole, an honest rendering of a Hebrew original _as the translator understood it_."

54: "On the basis of the above profile, I further suggest that his main goal, evinced mostly in ways he departs from a mimetic translation, is _control_: control over the way the reader understands each segment of the book."
