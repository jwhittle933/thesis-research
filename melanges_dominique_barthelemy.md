## Bible Exegesis and Textual Criticism: Isaiah 49,11 MT and LXX, by Moshe Henry Goshen-Gottstein
93: "A different Hebrew reading in an apparatus appended to MT __is__ a fact. Never mind our evaluation...Complexity starts when we cross language lines, that is to say when retroversion is attempted, say, from Syriac into Greek into Hebrew, etc...In this latter case there are very few absolutely assured facts."
