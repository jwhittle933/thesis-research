## Notes
10:5 - Hb `אגר`/ Gk `διεσώθη`. Hb uncommon root (Deut. 28:39, Prov 6:8; 10:5), "to gather". Perhaps the root also conveyed rescue, or the Greek translator is embellishing. Gk `καῦμα` suggests embellishment. As well, the pairing `מֵבישׁ` / `ἀνεμόφθονος` are typical of his creativity.

10:6 - Hb `חמס` / `πένθος ἄωρον` "untimely sorrow"

10:7 - Hb `לברכה` / `μετ᾽ ἐγκωμίων` "with eulogy"

10:8 - Expansive, exegetical Hb `ואויל שפתים` / `ὁ δὲ ἄστεγος χείλεσιν σκλιάζων` "the one not holding lips, being crooked"
> "Being crooked" likely borrowed conceptually from v. 9

10:10a - `μετὰ δόλου`, epexegetical addition. Perhaps he was clarifying the Hebrew. `ἀνδράσι` sense addition.
10:10b - `ὁ δὲ ἐλέγχων μετὰ παρρησίας εἰρηνοποιεῖ`, completely new phrase. Hb `ואויל שפתים ילבט` repitition with v. 8b.

10:11a - `פי צדיק` / `χειρὶ δικαίου` "in the hand of a righteous person".
> 10:6b || 10:11b in Hebrew, but the two stichoi in Greek have been rewritten. The original parallelism isn't broken, but the repitition characteristic of Hebrew poetry has been lost. 6b `στόμα δὲ ἀσεβῶν καλύψει πένθος ἄωρον` || `στόμα δὲ ἀσεβοῦς καλύψει ἀπώλεια`, with a change in number between them.

10:12a - `ועל כל פשׁעים` / `πάντας δὲ τοὺς μὴ φιλονεικοῦντας`. Epexegetical rendering.
> The use of `φιλία` for `אהבה` is unusual and clearly a piece of the translator's re-read purpose. **This Could Use Research**

10:17a - `ארח להיים שוֹמֵר מוּסָר` could be read in two ways: "The one who gaurds instruction" OR "Instruction guards". Gk `φυλάσσει παιδεία` reads the latter. With `עוֹזֵב` in the second colon, "The one who forsakes", `שׁוֹמֵר` should probably be read substantivaly. 

10:18 - Hb `שפתי שׁקר` / `χείλη δίκαια`. The translator reversed the parallelism of the Hebrew, which was exclusively about deception, to bring back antithetical parallelism which is characteristic of every verse to the point. `ἀφρονέστατοι` "most foolish" for `כסיל` is part of the translator's flair.

10:19a - Hb `יחדל פשׁע` / `ἐκφεύξῃ ἁμαρτίαν` common feature of personalization from the translator.
10:19b - `φειδόμενος` (supplementary) continues the personalization, but is in parity with Hb `חשך`

10:20b - `כמעט` / `ἐκλείψει`

10:21a - Hb `ירעו רבים` / `ἐπίσταται ὑψηλά` 
10:21b - Hb `בחסר לב` / `ἐν ἐνδείᾳ`, leaves off "heart" and thereby changes the meaning.

10:22 - Hb `היא תעשׁיר` / Gk `ἐπὶ κεφαλὴν δικαίου`. Perhaps a textual mis-reading or mis-copy. Hebrew `היא` is unusual but not impossible, accounted for in the second stich by `αὕτη πλουτίζει`. 

10:24b - `יתן` / `δεκτή`. 

10:25b - `יסוד עולם` / `ἐκκλίνας σῴζεται εἰς τὸν ἀιῶνα`

10:26a - Gk + `βλαβερον`
10:26b - `העצל` / `παρανομία`, from concrete noun (person) to abstract noun (lawlessness).

10:30a - `ימוט` / `ἐνδώσει`, interesting exchange.

> Chapter 10 summary: the chapter deals with speech, i.e. `פי`, `לשׁון`, `שפתים`.
