## Notes
10:5 - Hb `אגר`/ Gk `διεσώθη`. Hb uncommon root (Deut. 28:39, Prov 6:8; 10:5), "to gather". Perhaps the root also conveyed rescue, or the Greek translator is embellishing. Gk `καῦμα` suggests embellishment. As well, the pairing `מֵבישׁ` / `ἀνεμόφθονος` are typical of his creativity.

10:6 - Hb `חמס` / `πένθος ἄωρον` "untimely sorrow"

10:7 - Hb `לברכה` / `μετ᾽ ἐγκωμίων` "with eulogy"

10:8 - Expansive, exegetical Hb `ואויל שפתים` / `ὁ δὲ ἄστεγος χείλεσιν σκλιάζων` "the one not holding lips, being crooked"
> "Being crooked" likely borrowed conceptually from v. 9

10:10a - `μετὰ δόλου`, epexegetical addition. Perhaps he was clarifying the Hebrew. `ἀνδράσι` sense addition.
10:10b - `ὁ δὲ ἐλέγχων μετὰ παρρησίας εἰρηνοποιεῖ`, completely new phrase. Hb `ואויל שפתים ילבט` repitition with v. 8b.

10:11a - `פי צדיק` / `χειρὶ δικαίου` "in the hand of a righteous person".
> 10:6b || 10:11b in Hebrew, but the two stichoi in Greek have been rewritten. The original parallelism isn't broken, but the repitition characteristic of Hebrew poetry has been lost. 6b `στόμα δὲ ἀσεβῶν καλύψει πένθος ἄωρον` || `στόμα δὲ ἀσεβοῦς καλύψει ἀπώλεια`, with a change in number between them.

10:12a - `ועל כל פשׁעים` / `πάντας δὲ τοὺς μὴ φιλονεικοῦντας`. Epexegetical rendering.
> The use of `φιλία` for `אהבה` is unusual and clearly a piece of the translator's re-read purpose. **This Could Use Research**
