# Additions in OG Proverbs 1-9

**1:7ab**

*Greek*
```
Ἀρχὴ σοφίας φόβος θεοῦ
σύνεσις δὲ ἀγαθὴ πᾶσι τοῖς ποιοῦσιν αὐτήν
εὐσέβεια δὲ εἰς θεὸν ἀρχὴ αἰσθέσεως
σοφίαν δὲ καὶ παιδείαν ἀσεβεῖς ἐξουθενήσουσιν
```
*Hebrew*
```
יראת יהוה ראשׁית דעת
חכמה ומוסר אוילים בזו
```
Greek Proverbs 1:7 is noticeably longer than the MT (4 stichoi versus 2). Line 7a corresponds closely to Hb and should be considered a fairly free translation, with the subject and predicate reversed and the choice of σοφία for דעת. Hb 7b appears quite literally translated in line Greek 7d, which leaves 7bc as apparently extraneous to the parent. Lines 7bc, then, could potentially be free translator additions sandwiched between the original two lines. A difficulty arises in 7c, however, as the stich could reasonably be considered a free translation of Hb 7a (see specifically ἀρχὴ αἰσθέσεως as the semantic path [^1] ). In 7d, ἀσεβεῖς for Hb אוילים would then exemplify the moralizing tendency of the translator throughout OG. [^2] This is not to say that the author of Hb Proverbs considered foolishness a morally neutral category, but the translator typically strengthens and shifts the language to more explicitly moral terms.
	Before more can be said about translation technique, the difficulty of the additional lines must be resolved. Two preliminary options are available: double rendering or assimilation. If taken to be a double translation, this would mark the first of many in the translation as a whole. However, another difficulty arises, namely, that it breaks from the common pattern for doubles in OG Proverbs. Double renderings typically take the form of a bistich where the two lines lie adjacent in the text and where both clearly correspond to a single line in the parent. In the case of Greek 1:7, either the Hebrew in its entirety has be translated twice or Hb 7a alone has been translated twice (OG 7ac) and is separated by an additional stich. In either case, OG 7b stands out as either exegetical provision of context or the translator’s creativity with no clear semantic path from parent to translation. 
	Alternatively, the translator assimilated the text of OG Psalm 110:10 [Hb 111:10] into his translation without a doubling of the usual pattern. [^3] The texts of the Psalm in Greek and Hebrew are presented below:

| text                                                                                                                 | translation |
| -----------                                                                                                          | ----------- |
| ἀρχὴ σοφίας φόβος κυρίου<br>σύνεσις ἀγαθὴ πᾶσι τοῖς ποιοῦσιν αὐτήν<br>ἡ αἴνεσις αὐτοῦ μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος | The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord,<br>understanding is good to those who practice it,<br>His praise endures forever.    |
| ראשׁית חכמה יראת יהוה<br>שׂכל טוב לכל עשׂיהם<br>תהלתו עמדת לעד<br>                                                      | The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord,<br>good understanding to all who practice them,<br>His praise endures forever.  |

D’Hamonville remarks that there is both doubling (where 7cd correspond to Hb) and a “borrowing” from Psalm 110 (111) for 7ab, who also views 7a (and 5a) as forming an inclusio of sorts with OG 9:9a and 10a.*1* Doubling, for D’Hamonville, is essentially on the basis of two Hebrew lines reflected by 4 Greek lines.*2* He also rejects the idea that the additional material is Hexaplaric. Cook likewise rejects Hexaplaric origins and believes that the translator “deliberately quotes from the Psalm in order to make a clear statement as to where knowledge and wisdom originate”.*3* Joosten’s comment is the most thorough:
“Dans la LXX, le v. 7 est redoublé...Ce sont les stiques cd qui correspondent au TM, le « addition » ab apparaissant comme un emprunt au Ps 110 (111), 10”. David Marc D’Hamonville, Les Proverbes, La Bible D’Alexandrie 17 (Paris: Cerf, 2000), 160-161.
*2*For an in-depth treatment of double translations, see Zippora Talshir, “Double Translations in the Septuagint”, VI Congress of the International Organization for Septuagint and Cognate Studies, Jerusalem 1986 (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1987). In it she defines double translations as “cases of one item in the Masoretic Text (MT) being matched with two items in the Septuagint (LXX)” (21), though she concedes that there is space for diverging views. Her definition extends to the entirety of the Greek Old Testament, and as such is broad enough to encompass many different forms of double translations. For Greek Proverbs, her definition is too broad to meaningfully classify actual examples of double renderings.

The additional lines undoubtedly have their origin in the Psalms. The problem is that it is hard to know at what stage the addition was made. It is possible that the translator was the one who borrowed the addition from the Greek version of Psalms. But other scenarios can be imagined as well. The additional lines may have been present already in the Hebrew source text of Prov. 1:7. If so, the Greek translation could be original in Proverbs and borrowed in Psalms. Another possibility is that the additional lines were added into the Greek text of Proverbs secondarily, in the course of scribal transmission.*1*

In other words, tracing the origin of the material is a tricky business indeed.
Regarding a variant Hebrew tradition, the external evidence does not provide enough to support it.*1* Two traditions which have an established dependence on the OG, Peshitta (in Proverbs) and Vetus Latina (all of OG), support the stichic structure in MT:
