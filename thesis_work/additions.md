# Additions in OG Proverbs 1-9

**1:7ab**
*Greek*
```
Ἀρχὴ σοφίας φόβος θεοῦ
σύνεσις δὲ ἀγαθὴ πᾶσι τοῖς ποιοῦσιν αὐτήν
εὐσέβεια δὲ εἰς θεὸν ἀρχὴ αἰσθέσεως
σοφίαν δὲ καὶ παιδείαν ἀσεβεῖς ἐξουθενήσουσιν
```
*Hebrew*
```
יראת יהוה ראשׁית דעת
חכמה ומוסר אוילים בזו
```
Greek Proverbs 1:7 is noticeably longer than the MT (4 stichoi versus 2). Line 7a corresponds closely to Hb and should be considered a fairly free translation, with the subject and predicate reversed and the choice of σοφία for דעת. Hb 7b appears quite literally translated in line Greek 7d, which leaves 7bc as apparently extraneous to the parent. Lines 7bc, then, could potentially be free translator additions sandwiched between the original two lines. A difficulty arises in 7c, however, as the stich could reasonably be considered a free translation of Hb 7a (see specifically ἀρχὴ αἰσθέσεως as the semantic path[^1]). In 7d, ἀσεβεῖς for Hb אוילים would then exemplify the moralizing tendency of the translator throughout OG.[^2] This is not to say that the author of Hb Proverbs considered foolishness a morally neutral category, but the translator typically strengthens and shifts the language to more explicitly moral terms.
	Before more can be said about translation technique, the difficulty of the additional lines must be resolved. Two preliminary options are available: double rendering or assimilation. If taken to be a double translation, this would mark the first of many in the translation as a whole. However, another difficulty arises, namely, that it breaks from the common pattern for doubles in OG Proverbs. Double renderings typically take the form of a bistich where the two lines lie adjacent in the text and where both clearly correspond to a single line in the parent. In the case of Greek 1:7, either the Hebrew in its entirety has be translated twice or Hb 7a alone has been translated twice (OG 7ac) and is separated by an additional stich. In either case, OG 7b stands out as either exegetical provision of context or the translator’s creativity with no clear semantic path from parent to translation. 
	Alternatively, the translator assimilated the text of OG Psalm 110:10 [Hb 111:10] into his translation without a doubling of the usual pattern.[^3] The texts of the Psalm in Greek and Hebrew are presented below:

| ἀρχὴ σοφίας φόβος κυρίου<br>σύνεσις ἀγαθὴ πᾶσι τοῖς ποιοῦσιν αὐτήν<br>ἡ αἴνεσις αὐτοῦ μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος |
| ראשׁית חכמה יראת יהוה<br>שׂכל טוב לכל עשׂיהם<br>תהלתו עמדת לעד<br>                                                                                                          |
