`στροφὰς λόγων` for `מוסר השכל`, which are perhaps conceptually different but the semantic path is detectable

## 3b 
Greek forms two _cola_ from a single Hebrew and mutated the last Hebrew adjective `מישׁרים` to a verb, `κατευθύνειν`. In one sense, he added a new type of parallelism. The newly formed tristich now features a verb in each line. `צדך` becomes `νοῆσαί τε δικαιοσύνην ἀληθῆ`, `משׁפט` becomes `κα`κρίμα κατευθύνειν`.
