# Proverbs 1
All verse references are relative to the MT

### 1a
**Literal**

### 1b
Change from noun phrase (`מלך ישראל`) to relative clause + finite verb + preposition phrase (`ὅς ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ισραηλ`**

### 2a 
**Literal**

### 2b 
**Literal**

### 3a 
`στροφὰς λόγων` for `מוסר השכל`, which are perhaps conceptually different but the semantic path is detectable

### 3b 
Greek forms two _cola_ from a single Hebrew and mutated the last Hebrew adjective `מישׁרים` to a verb, `κατευθύνειν`. In one sense, he added a new type of parallelism. The newly formed tristich now features a verb in each line. `צדך` becomes `νοῆσαί τε δικαιοσύνην ἀληθῆ`, `משׁפט` becomes `καὶ κρίμα κατευθύνειν`. 
| Hebrew  | Greek Equivalent |
| ----:   | -----------      |
| לקחת    | δέξασθαί         |
| מוסר    | στροφὰς          |
| חשכל    | λόγων(?)         |
|         | νοῆσαί           |
|         | τε               |
| צדך     | δικαιοσύνην      |
|         | ἀληθῆ            |
| ו       | καὶ              |
| משׁפת    | κρίμα            |
| ומישׁרים | κατευθύνειν      |

### 4a
Translator added `ἵνα` and changed the infinitive `לתת` to a finite subjunctive `δῷ`, perhaps "he" being either Solomon or YHWH. Otherwise semantically and syntagmatically **Literal**

### 4b
Mostly **Literal**, but the translator added `τε` between the noun pair, and qualified `παιδί` with `νέῳ`.

### 5a
**Literal** in its own right, but with some freer elements. The first Hb verb `ישׁמע`, a jussive most likely, is rendered as a supplementary participle `ἀκούσας`, whose object is a demonstrative pronoun `τῶνδε`. A subtle change from Hb `ויסף לקח` to Gk `σοφὸς σοφώτερος ἔσται** but semantically similar. Verbal mood has changed from potential to future.

### 5b
**Literal**

### 6a
**Literal**

### 6b
**Literal**

### 7a
Two _stichoi_ for 1 Hb as well as a reversal in the order of constituents, `יראת יהוה ראשׁית דעת` and `ἀρχὴ σοφίας φόβος θεοῦ`. The words are nearly identical to Psa 110:10ab LXX and most likely came from there. It's also possible that Psa 110 has borrowed this rendering from here and Proverbs is original. Perhaps there is some explanatory power to the second option, seeing that 7cd are another translation of Hb 7ab, perhaps this is a double rendering.

### 7b
See above. Hb 7b is matched by Gk 7d, which is quite **Literal**.

> Excursus on v. 7: As Hb Proverbs 1:7a and Psa 111:10a are quite similar, its possible that both translators simply created identical translations. In this event, there is still need for explanation of the 7bc. 7b definitively comes from Psa 110:10b LXX, but how it got here is still unclear. Translator copying, corruption in transmission, etc. The presence of `δὲ` in 7b suggests to me that this is from the translator. The final product is 4 _stichoi_ that have a doubly-rendered effect.

### 8a
Mostly **Literal**. Hb `בני` 'my son' becomes `υἱέ`, 'son**, and is consistent throughout 1-9. 

### 8b
**Literal**, singular `תורת` becomes plural `θεσμούς`.
