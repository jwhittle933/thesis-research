# Proverbs 1
All verse references are relative to the MT

### 1a
**Literal**

### 1b
Change from noun phrase (`מלך ישראל`) to relative clause + finite verb + preposition phrase (`ὅς ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ισραηλ`)

### 2a 
**Literal**

### 2b 
**Literal**

### 3a 
`στροφὰς λόγων` for `מוסר השכל`, which are perhaps conceptually different but the semantic path is detectable

### 3b 
Greek forms two _cola_ from a single Hebrew and mutated the last Hebrew adjective `מישׁרים` to a verb, `κατευθύνειν`. In one sense, he added a new type of parallelism. The newly formed tristich now features a verb in each line. `צדך` becomes `νοῆσαί τε δικαιοσύνην ἀληθῆ`, `משׁפט` becomes `καὶ κρίμα κατευθύνειν`. 
| Hebrew  | Greek Equivalent |
| ----:   | -----------      |
| לקחת    | δέξασθαί         |
| מוסר    | στροφὰς          |
| חשכל    | λόγων(?)         |
|         | νοῆσαί           |
|         | τε               |
| צדך     | δικαιοσύνην      |
|         | ἀληθῆ            |
| ו       | καὶ              |
| משׁפת    | κρίμα            |
| ומישׁרים | κατευθύνειν      |

### 4a
Translator added `ἵνα` and changed the infinitive `לתת` to a finite subjunctive `δῷ`, perhaps "he" being either Solomon or YHWH. Otherwise semantically and syntagmatically **Literal**

### 4b
Mostly **Literal**, but the translator added `τε` between the noun pair, and qualified `παιδί` with `νέῳ`.

### 5a
**Literal** in its own right, but with some freer elements. The first Hb verb `ישׁמע`, a jussive most likely, is rendered as a supplementary participle `ἀκούσας`, whose object is a demonstrative pronoun `τῶνδε`. A subtle change from Hb `ויסף לקח` to Gk `σοφὸς σοφώτερος ἔσται` but semantically similar. Verbal mood has changed from potential to future.

### 5b
**Literal**

### 6a
**Literal**

### 6b
**Literal**

### 7a
Two _stichoi_ for 1 Hb as well as a reversal in the order of constituents, `יראת יהוה ראשׁית דעת` and `ἀρχὴ σοφίας φόβος θεοῦ`. The words are nearly identical to Psa 110:10ab LXX and most likely came from there. It's also possible that Psa 110 has borrowed this rendering from here and Proverbs is original. Perhaps there is some explanatory power to the second option, seeing that 7cd are another translation of Hb 7ab, perhaps this is a double rendering.

### 7b
See above. Hb 7b is matched by Gk 7d, which is quite **Literal**.

> Excursus on v. 7: As Hb Proverbs 1:7a and Psa 111:10a are quite similar, its possible that both translators simply created identical translations. In this event, there is still need for explanation of the 7bc. 7b definitively comes from Psa 110:10b LXX, but how it got here is still unclear. Translator copying, corruption in transmission, etc. The presence of `δὲ` in 7b suggests to me that this is from the translator. The final product is 4 _stichoi_ that have a doubly-rendered effect.

### 8a
Mostly **Literal**. Hb `בני` 'my son' becomes `υἱέ`, 'son', and is consistent throughout 1-9. 

### 8b
**Literal**, singular `תורת` becomes plural `θεσμούς`.

### 9a
Baseline of **Literality**, with some freer elements. Rather than the `תורה` and `מוסר` being a "crown of grace" (Hb), the son will recieve `δέξῃ`.

### 9b
Baseline of **Literality**. The `ענקים` is now a `κλοιὸν χρύσεον`, a "golden collar". Hb `ל` preposition become `περί`, "around".

### 10a
Freer, with what seems to be an intentional change of mood. Hb `בני` rendered typically as `υἱέ`. Hb `אם` "if" is lacking and the conditional mood is replaced by the subjunctive mood with `μή` + `πλανήσωσιν`. Semantically, the two moods aren't completely unrelated. Hb `חטאים` become the more explicit `ἄνδρες ἀσεβεῖς`, a favorite of the translator.

### 10b
Either freely rendered based on the translator's new direction, mistranslated, or representing an alternative versification from antiquity. Hebrew is two words, `אל תבא` which pairs well will 10a but reads prosaically. This expression is rendered in Greek with `μηδὲ βουληθῇς`, a literal rendering. The translator then grabbed 11a (Hb `אם יאמרו`) and brought it into 10b as `ἐὰν παρακαλέσωσί σε λέγοντες`. The additional participle is unmatched but is typical Greek for this period. As the translator's _Vorlage_ was unmarked for verse, its possible that he was reading the correct verse tradition and the MT has incorrectly divided a stich.
> Verse 10 on the whole is unique in that it is significantly shorter than all the other verses in the chapter and lacks the parallel balance of AB cadence that the verses to this point have shared. Verse 11 does mark a shift in the chapter with direct speech, so perhaps this verse marks the movement in that direction. The translator perhaps felt the need to bring more balance to this verse.

### 11a
Freely rendered. For `אם יאמרו`, see above. Hb `לכה אתנו` is literally rendered by `ἐλθὲ μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν`. Gk `κοινωνέω` for Hb `ארב` is unusual and this is the only occurence of this pairing in the LXX (though the verb isn't common in OG, mainly in the non-translated books). Conceptually "lying in wait for blood" and "sharing in blood" are not entirely unrelated here and perhaps this combination was more sensible or arousing to the readers. Perhaps the notion of "sharing/taking part in" was borrowed contextually from 14a.

### 11b
Freely translated. Gk `κρύψωμεν` is a fair rendering of `נצפנה`, except in this locution `צפן` is intransitive. In Gk, rather than hiding themselves as in Hb, the scoundrels are hiding a man in the ground. The `נקי` of Hebrew becomes `ἀνδρα δίκαιον`, showing the translator's preference for moralizing emphasis. He is clearly creating contrast between the unrighteous and the righteous, and perhaps painting a picture of the natural relationship between them. Hb `הנם` "without cause" become more explicitly moral in `ἀδίκως`. Gk `εἰς γῆν` is unmatched in Hb.

### 12a
**Literal**. One exception to literality is the change from 3mpl `ם` on `נבלעם` to Gk `αὐτόν`. This is in keeping with the previous verse where the generic `נקי` becomes `ἄνδρα δίκαιον`.

### 12b
Interpretive translation. There is little semantically related between the versions, but a conceptual link remains. Hb `תמימים` parallels `היים`, with the verbal phrase elided, which would mean "let us swallow them whole", following a likely ABCC´Β´Α´ chiastic pattern. Gk `καὶ ἄρωμεν αὐτοῦ τὴν μνήμην ἐκ γῆς` is conceptually linked to Hb, but not semantically or syntagmantically. The man whom they hid `εἰς γῆν` now has his memory removed `ἐκ γῆς`. Perhaps this is another instance of new parallelism on part of the translator.

### 13a 
**Literal**, with some minor alterations. The presence of `αὐτοῦ` continues the case specificity that Greek adds. Hb is describing a more general circumstance. Hb `נמצא` is not morphologically a cohortative, but following on the heals of 1 imperative and 3 cohortatives, this should probably be read that way (and the translator did `καταλαβώμεθα`). `τὴν κτῆσιν τὴν πολυτελῆ` is a fair representation of `הון יקר`, though the Hb is slightly more generic.

### 13b
**Literal**. See above for the cohortative `נמלא`. `οἴκους ἡμετέρους` is good Greek.

### 14a
**Literal**. Translator recognized the modality of `תפיל` by rendering it with `βάλε`.

### 14bc
First occurence of **_Double Translation_**, both lines reflecting a fairly **Literal** translation. 14b fits the translator's style overall more than 14c, perhaps reflecting Hexaplaric addition. In 14b, `כיס אחד` becomes `κοινὸν βαλλάντιον`, which reflects the sense of the Hb. 14c renders more quantitatively, `μαρσίππιον ἕν`. As well, `κτησώμεθα` in 14b is more interpretive and reflects the sense of Hb, whereas `γενηθήτω` in 14c is more 1-to-1 with Hb. Interestingly, 14b `πάντες` captures Hb `כל` where 14c has ommitted it semantically. Lest the thought arise, neither 14b or 14c reflects a more literal translation than the other. For example, the presence of `καί` and the absence of a lexeme for `כל` fails to meet more rigid definitions of literality. This is the 2nd occurence of `κτάομαι** in chapter 1, showing that perhaps the traslator does feel the need for repitition of lexemes, even if they are not rendering the same Hb lexeme.

### 15a
**Literal**, but `בני` isn't rendered, perhaps testifying to a different _Vorlage_, but not necessarily so.

### 15b
**Literal**

### 16a
**Literal**

### 16b
**Literal**, with transformations. Hb finite _yiqtol_ + _waw_ `וימהרו` is rendered by a verbless clause with subject change from 16a, `(οἱ πόδες) ταχινοί`. Presumably in Hb, the "they" of the verb is the deviant individuals, but not necessarily so.

### 17
Presumably two _stichoi_ in Hb are collapsed to 1 in Gk, but ignoring the Masoretic accents this could be read as a single line. This is the second occurence of `ἀδίκως` === `חנם`.The first half is **Literal**. Hb `בעיני כל בעל כנף` is collapsed to `πτερωτοῖς`, "before the birds", which is syntagmatically distinct but entirely justfiable by target standards. "Before the eyes of every master of wing" is normal Hebrew but altogether alien Greek.

### 18
Very free, nearly unrecognizable and best to discuss at the level of the lexeme rather than the stich. Gk add `γάρ` which creates causality that isn't explicit in the Hb paratactic `ו`.
Gk `οἱ φόνου μετέχοντες` makes the conceptual link explicit, though this is lacking in the Hb. This is the 2nd time `ארב` + `לדם` has been transformed. Perhaps the translator felt that he Hebrew expression wouldn't have the import in Greek. This is also the 2nd time intransitive `צפן` has been transformed to a transitive Greek verb, here `θησαυρίζω`. Whereas in Hb, the scoundrels are lying in wait for their own lives (a non-obligatory prepositional phrase), in Gk the same are storing up `κακά` "for themselves" (dative of interest). The expressions `לנפשתם` and `ἐαυτοῖς`, in another context, would be quite appropriately paired, but in this case the thrust of the Hebrew is in a slightly different direction than the Greek. The overall translation captures the concepts of the Hb, but with a new flair. 18b is an entirely unmatched, explanatory gloss, perhaps from an external source or something common at the time and place of translation. Gk `ἀνδρῶν παρανόμων` again continues the translator's moralizing emphasis.

### 19a
Semi-**Literal**, with freedom. Gk `αὕται αἵ ὁδοί` is a fair rendering of `כן ארחות`. Hb `בצע בצע` becomes `τῶν συντελούντων τὰ ἄνομα`, which perhaps fits well within the translator's penchant for specific moral emphases with respect to lawlessness (though not necessarily `תורה`). Lexemes aside, the syntagma in 18a is fairly literally represented.

### 19b
There is a **Literal** semantic path from Hb to Gk, with some freedom. Hb `יקח` is difficult in its own right. The singular is a bit out of place and it's not clear who or what the subject is. `ארחות` is plural, but in poetry, this doesn't remove it from the pool of options. Perhaps `את` is an emphatic marker of subject and `יקח` should be read as Qal passive/Nifal, "the life of its master is taken away". This presents as many problems as it solves, and many more still exist, which may account for the translator's rendering. This being the case, `τὴν ἑαυτῶν ψυχὴν ἀφαιροῦνται` captures the general purport of the Hebrew without the diffuculties. Gk `τῇ γὰρ ἀσεβείᾳ` is unmatched in the Hb, but fits the translator's morally explicit tendency.

### 20a
**Literal**. Hb `רנן` here, according to HALOT, means something like "cry aloud", but the general semantic field of the word includes "sing", which explains `ὑμνεῖται`. Here, however, rather than Wisdom singing Wisdom is sung. Perhaps an anti-anthropomorphic motivation. Hb `תרנה` could also be interpreted as a passive, even though the Pual is rare (1x) and there are no known Nifals in the MT.

### 20b
Freely translated based on 20a. The translator, based on `ὑμνέω` in 20a, portays wisdom as being a song-leader with `παρρησίαν ἄγει`, verb + adverbial accusative, "she leads with vigor/boldly". The transition is odd, since Wisdom is the patient in the previous stich. The transition to agent here matches her transition to agent in 21bc (double). Hb `ברחבות` rendered literally by `ἐν πλατείας`. 

### 21a
**Literally** translated with either an error or a different _Vorlage_. Translator read `המוֹת` "walls" rather than `המיות` from `המה`, "to bustle/be noisy". Wisdom again becomes the patient rather than the agent in `κηρύσσεται`, "she is preached", matching stich a of 20.

### 21bc
Second occurence of double rendering in OG Proverbs. The Hb double prepositional phrase is broken into two lines. If one of these _stichoi_ were Hexaplaric, one would expect one of the lines to more closely represent Hb. As it stands, neither line fully captures the Hb. 21b `δυναστῶν` is unmatched in the Hb, as is `παρεδρεύει`. 21c `θαρροῦσα` is semantically unmatched in Hb, but I wonder if the cognate noun phrase `אמריה תאמר` was taken emphatically.

### 22
Very interpretive and best handled as a unit. Hb frames a question, `עד מתי`, "how long?", which becomes a indefinite modal, `ὅσον ἄν χρόνον`, "as long as". Gk `ἄκακοι` is a fair rendering of Hb `פתים`, and is usual for the translator, but Hb paints the "simple" in a negative light whereas the "innocent" in Gk is looked on positively. Gk `ἐχωνται τῆς δικαιοσύνης` is both semantically and conceptually foreign. One wonders if the new semantic shape is due to the translator's desire to draw a line between the righteous and unrighteous, or even if his _Vorlage_ was corrupted in some way. Perhaps he read `לצים לצון` as something to the effect of `לא לצון`, which he understood as "not derided", which could explain `οὐκ αἰσχυντήσονται`. This fails to explain the absence of `תאהבו` in the Gk and even `חמדו`, unless 22b `ὄντες ἐπιθυμηταί` is matched here.

Another explanation could be that 22a is freely adapted to the translator's purpose, and that 22bc is captured by Gk 22bc semi-freely. In this scenario, Hb `לצים` becomes `ἄφρονες` and `חמדו` becomes `ὄντες ἐπιθυμηταί`, and finally `לצון` becomes `ὕβρεως`. The second lexeme pair is sensible and can be called **Literal**, as can the 3rd lexeme pair. 22c can also be consdiered fairly **Literal**, though clause is subordinate to 22b. Gk `ἐμίσησαν αἴσθησιν` is a **Literal** rendering of Hb `וכסילים ישנאו דעת`. The concept of "fool", however, was captured in 22b, and the `כסילים` becomes `ἀσεβεῖς`. 
 
The three Hb lines are describing the same type of individual from 3 perspectives through parallelism. The Gk, in some respects, draws this connection stronger through the use of participles and subordinate clauses.

### 23a
The Hebrew meaning can be debated. ESV renders "If you turn at my reproof", with a note that it could be a question, "Will you turn away at my reproof". The first option is much more plausible, as it best accounts for the following `הנה` and reads `תשׁובו` modally. Gk `ὑπεύθυνοι` is freely rendered with no clear semantic path.

### 23b
Freely rendered, with some **Literality**. Gk `προήσομαι` belongs to the same semantic field as `נבע`. Hb `רוחי` becomes in Gk `ἐμῆς πνοῆς ῥῆσιν`, which is curious.

### 23c
**Literal**. Hb `דברי` "my words" becomes Gk `τὸν ἐμὸν λόγον`, a switch to the singular, which is accurate based on the consonants. Addition of Gk `δὲ** is usual for the translator.

### 24a
**Literal**. Hb `ותמאנו` becomes `οὐχ ὑπηκούσατε`, which is the semantically transformed negative. Hb encodes the negative nuance lexemically.

### 24b
**Literal**. Hb `ידי` is transformed to `λόγούς` which fits the new context in Gk, where Wisdom is pouring out words and speech. Gk `προσέχω` for Hb `קשׁב` (Hif** is the first of many of this pair.

### 25a
**Literal**. Hb `פרע` "to disregard" is encoded in Gk as `ἀκύρους ἐποιεῖτε`. Singlur to plural shift in `βουλάς`.

### 25b
**Literal**. Gk `ἀπειθέω` "refuse compliance" (LSJ) for Hb `אבה`. Another plural shift in `ἐλένχοις`.

### 26a
**Literal**. Gk `τοιγαροῦν` a Greek polish. Gk `ὑμετέρα` shows the translator's preference up to this point for the adjectival pronouns.
> A study of the adjectival pronouns in OG Proverbs would be a great paper.

### 26b
**Literal**. Addition of `δέ`.

### 27a
**Literal**, with freer elements. Gk `ἄφνω` is unmatched in the Hb. Gk `θόρυβος` and Hb `פחד` do not normally occupy the same semantic space. Hb possesive suffix is excluded. Hb `כשׁואה** is omitted, perhaps to avoid repetition with 27b.

### 27b
**Literal**. Hb possessive suffix again excluded.

### 27c
**Literal**. Hb `עליכם` captured by Gk `ὑμῖν`. Gk 27d **Double Rendering?**, or corruption from 26b (`ἡνίκα ἄν ἔρχηται ὄλεθρος`)? Perhaps added to echo 26b. If it truly is a double rendering of Hb 27c, it constitutes a fairly **Literal** rendering, minus 1 word.

### 28a
Free adaptations with **Literal** backbone. Gk `ἔσται γὰρ ὅταν` captures Hb `אז`, but removes the future nuance of Hb toward a subjunctive/potential mood. Hb `לא אענא` "I will not answer" is transformed to `οὐκ εἰσακούσομαι` "I will not listen" plus an object `ὑμῶν`.

### 28b
**Literal**, but with a moral addition of `κακοἰ**.

### 29
**Literal**

### 30a
Free with **Literal** elements. Translator added `οὐδέ` to create parity with 29. Hb `אבו` becomes `ἤθελον προσέχειν`, which is a fair rendering though contrived. Gk `προσέχω` is the sterotypical pairing to `קשׁב` (TC issue?).

### 30b
**Literal**, minus `כל`.

### 31a
**Literal**, plus `τοιγαροῦν` which likely derives from the _yiqtol_ + _waw_ for consequence or result.

### 31b
**Literal**, except `ממעצתיהם` becomes `ἀσεβείας`, either out of the translator's commitment to moral distinctions or becuase he didn't know the word (likely the former).

### 32a
Freely rendered. Hb `כי` perhaps becomes `ἀνθ᾽ ὧν γὰρ`, if not the whole expression at least `γάρ`. The preposition and (incorporated?) relative pronoun are perhaps flair. Hb `משׁובת פתים` becomes `ἠδίκουν νηπίους`. Perhaps the translator misunderstood `משׁובה`, or took an opportunity for more righteous/unrighteous contrast, as he's gone to great lengths thus far to portray the evil-doer who would take advantage of the simple (who, in this context, are `ἄκακοι`). Now that the simple are innocent, its not simplicity that `תהרגם`, but those who act maliciously toward the innocent `φονευθήσονται`. The translator has captured the thrust of the Hebrew in more lines (cf. 18a `οἱ φόνου μετέχοντες`), where the snare that the scoundrels leave for the innocent end up being their own death trap.

### 32b
Freely translated. `שׁלוה` becomes `ἐξετασμός` "inquiry", perhaps suggesting that evildoers will have their day before a judge (YHWH?). Per usual, the `כסילים` become `ἀσεβεῖς`.

### 33a
**Literal**, with Hb `בטה` becoming `ἐπ᾽ ἐλπίδι`.

### 33b
**Literal**, with flair.
