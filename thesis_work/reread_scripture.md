# Outline criticisms
- All translation is interpration
- Rather than defining the term "re-reading", focus on the translation method for LXX Proverbs, methodology.
- Distinctive things the LXX does in handling Proverbs
- Then bring it around as "re-reading" if it fits the data, put a label on it
- Don't get bogged down in convincing the reader of a new definition, focus on the distinctive forms

## Alternatives?
Argue instead that the translator of Proverbs did not have a translation methodology (or that it was dynamic, piecemeal). To call his translation technique "free" is to give it a technique.

## Alternative Title - Literalism Through Freedom: Striking a Balance Between Source and Target in the Translation of OG Proverbs

## Alternative Title 2 - Between a Rock and a Soft Place: The Literal Elements of OG Proverbs
Or perhaps "Literally Free", "Between Literality and Freedom". Considering iterpretation as the _sine qua non_ of translation, this study would proceed by showing the literal elements present in the more freely translated sections.
