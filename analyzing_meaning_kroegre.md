# Analyzing Meaning: An Introduction to Semantics and Pragmatics, 2nd Ed. by Paul Kroeger

1: "Perhaps the most important fact about word meanings is that they must be shared by the speech community: speakers of a given language must agree, at least most of the time, about what each word means."

1: "...the conventions for extending meanings must also be shared by the speech community. In other words, there seems to be rules even for bending the rules."

1: "...semantics is concerned with the inherent meaning of words and sentences as linguistic expressions, in and of themselves, while PRAGMATICS is concerned with those aspects of meaning that depend on or derive from the way in which the words and sentences are used."

2: "A sentence is a linguistic expression, a well-formed string of words, while an utterance is a speech event by a particular speaker in a specific context. When a speaker uses a sentence in a specific context, he produces an utterance."

7: "Idiomatic phrases are by definition non-compositional: the meaning of the phrase is not predictable from the meanings of the individual words. The meaning of the whole phrase must be learned as a unit."
