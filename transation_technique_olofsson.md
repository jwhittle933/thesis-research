# Translation Technique and Theological Exegesis by Steffan Olafsson

15: "Many emendations based on the Septuagint in the last part of the twentieth century have been verifed by the Qumran texts."
- Not necessarily. Many cases of scribal errors/alterations could come from the same impulse that we feel, namely that a text doesn't seem to fit our current expectations of grammar, syntax, lexicography, etc.

16: "...in my opinion, a serious understanding of the translator's theology and the _Vorlage_ of the translation are _only_ possible after an investigation of thet tranlation techniqe""

60: "I suggest that the aspects that affect thet possibility to employ consistency as a sign of literality in absolute terms are the following:"
1) _The semantic range of the Hebrew word_
2) _The resources and the demands of the target language_
3) _The genre and other characteristics of the Hebrew text_
4) _The translator's knowledge of Hebrew_
5) _The unit on which the translation is based, viz. word, phrase, sentence_
6) _The Vorlage of the Greek word_

62: "The type of consistency that is a sign of literality is one where the translators _deliberately aimed at increased regularity_ in the choice of equivalents, despite that the outcome was a translation where the nuances of the original were rubbed out and the target language was not employed in a natural way."
