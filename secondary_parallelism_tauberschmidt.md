# Secondary Parallelism: A Study of Translation Technique in LXX Proverbs by Gerhard Tauberschmidt

preface: "In this study I show that the translator of LXX Proverbs frequently rendered Hebrew parallelism in a form that is more closely parallel than the MT"

8: "Therefore it is necessary to judge each book individually and discuss translation principles/techniques as they are applied in a particular book."

16: "Parallelism can also be found in the LXX, not just as a copy of Hebrew parallelism, but it may occur as an independent Greek form."

31: "The translator of LXX Proverbs took great pains to translate dynamic Hebrew parallelisms often less dynamically with closer corresponding lines semantically and/or grammatically"

33: "The translator tends to use word pairs and phrase pairs that are more closely parallel synonymously (and antithetically cf. 1.2.1.4) than in the Hebrew."


NOTE: Tedious read, almost useless as anything other than a reference work, and that only if one assumes the correctness of the paradigm.
